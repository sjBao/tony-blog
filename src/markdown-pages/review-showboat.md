### Why I decided to listen to this:
One late Sunday afternoon (January 26th, 2020), I was getting ready to return home from a free-trial session of hot yoga. Feeling relaxed on what was otherwise a pretty good Sunday, I was plugging in my home address when I noticed on the newsfeed of my phone: "N.B.A. Star Kobe Bryant Dies in California Helicopter Crash". I couldn't believe it at first, but, as I saw friends, family, and other notible media figures respond to the tragedy, I realized that Kobe has passed, and it was hitting me a lot harder than I had expected.

I started watching baskebtall in the mid 2000's, so the basketball legends I became acquainted with were the likes of Allen Iverson, Carmelo Anthony, Tim Duncan, Paul Piece, Tracy Mcgracy, Yao Ming, Shaq, and of course Kobe Bryant. It wasn't until Kobe retired that I realized I've taken for granted what he brough to the league. And similarly, it wasn't until he passed did I realize I took for granted what he brought to world by how he lived life. Listening to his biography helped me mourn.

### Some notes I took (Feb 2020):
**1. How does this person inspire you to act?**

_This person taught me that success is showing up day after day. Having the drive and motivation to work towards your dreams and your goal day after day. Although this was not in the biography, in one of his speeches, Kobe says that the journey is the dream. Getting up when you don’t want to, putting in the work and grinding, working towards something; that IS the dream. Kobe inspires me to not procrastinate on what I want to do._

**2. What trait does the person possess that you wish you had? Why?**

_I wish I had the resolve, discipline and confidence that Kobe has. Growing up, I was always insecure and quick to give up. As a result, I was mediocre even at things that I had a natural disposition towards. I wish I was like Kobe in that once he set his mind on a goal, he works doggedly at it. I will try to carry this mentality going forward._

**3. What emotion does this person make you feel?**

_I feel sadness at the thought of not being able to see Kobe's post-basketball accomplishments. I also wonder what the families of all who were involved must feel. You can have all the secrets to life, but life can be so fickle. Its a reminder for those of us who still have time here to really give it our all._

**4. What experiences did the person have that are similar to your your own life?**

_Kobe was often seen as an outsider. Kobe is introverted, loves stories and sees the world through those lenses. He had difficulty reconciling his identity as an African American but who also grew up in Italy. Although my experiences are vastly different as I am Asian American, the theme of trying to reconcile the difference in heritage and upbringing with those around you is definitely something I can relate to._

**5. Would you like to be the person? Why or why not?**

_In some ways, of course I would have love to be Kobe Bryant. On the other hand, he dealt with many personal issues that I do not envy. He sacrificed whatever he thought was necessary to accomplish his goals of being great for better or for worse. I don’t think I would have had the mental fortitude and poise to handle all the challenges that he faced._

**6. Why would you recommend this biography to another reader?**

_Its a reminder that greatness requires sacrifice. Yet, despite that, life is short, moments with family and friends are precious. How are you spending your hours and minutes? This book doesn't answer these questions for me but it definitely gave me another lens to consider these questions._
